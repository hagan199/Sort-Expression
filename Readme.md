/**
 * Algebraic Expression Sorter
 * This JavaScript project provides a solution for sorting algebraic expressions based on their dependencies and detecting cyclic dependencies.
 *
 * 
@summary

 * The core problem involves taking a list of algebraic expressions as input and determining a solvable order, considering interdependencies between variables. Expressions with solvable right-hand sides are prioritized. The solution identifies circular dependencies that prevent a solvable order.
 *
 * 
@usage

 * 1. Clone or download the repository:
 *    ```bash
 *    git clone https://github.com/hagan199/Sort-Expression.git
 *    ```
 * 2. Install dependencies (if any):
 *    ```bash
 *    npm install
 *    ```
 * 3. Run the solution:
 *    ```bash
 *    node solution.js
 *    ```
