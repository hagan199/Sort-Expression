# Algebraic Expression Sorter

## Overview

The Algebraic Expression Sorter is a JavaScript project designed to solve the problem of sorting algebraic expressions based on their dependencies while detecting cyclic dependencies.

## Summary

The core problem tackled by this project is organizing a list of algebraic expressions in a solvable order, taking into account the interdependencies between variables. Expressions with solvable right-hand sides are given priority. Additionally, the solution identifies circular dependencies that would prevent a solvable order from being determined.

## Usage

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hagan199/Sort-Expression.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies (if any):**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
